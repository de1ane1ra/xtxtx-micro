xtxtx is a micro, minimalist text editor for your web browser.

It has very few features:  
1. Captures and renders keyboard input.
2. Resizable text area to represent desired # of rows and columns.
3. Save your work as a `.txt` file with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> or <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.
4. Presented in glorious monochrome.
